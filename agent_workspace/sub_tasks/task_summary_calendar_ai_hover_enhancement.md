# calendar_ai_hover_enhancement

Successfully enhanced the calendar view in the Reflect journaling app to display AI analysis scores and metrics on hover instead of entry content for analyzed entries. Implemented a comprehensive color coding system based on happiness scores (green for high scores 7-10, yellow for medium 5-6.9, orange for below average 3-4.9, red for low 0-2.9). Added visual indicators and updated the calendar legend to clearly distinguish between word count indicators and AI analysis score indicators. The enhancement provides users with immediate visual feedback about their emotional patterns over time while maintaining the calendar's readability and user experience.
