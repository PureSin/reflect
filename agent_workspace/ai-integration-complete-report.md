**Deployed Application URL:** https://2lmtukxuaknn.space.minimax.io

## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Overview

The Reflect journaling app now includes complete **on-device AI analysis** powered by WebLLM, providing:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional tone detection with confidence scores
- **Happiness Metrics**: 5-dimensional wellbeing analysis (life satisfaction, positive emotions, social support, etc.)
- **Complete Privacy**: All AI processing happens locally in your browser - no data ever leaves your device
- **Persistent Results**: Analysis results are saved and remain available across sessions

## ðŸš€ How to Test the AI Features

### Step 1: Enable WebLLM Model
1. Open the deployed app: https://2lmtukxuaknn.space.minimax.io
2. Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
3. In the "AI Features" section, click **"Load AI Model"**
4. Wait for model download (~1.8GB) - this only happens once
5. Watch the progress bar complete until status shows "Ready for AI analysis"

### Step 2: Create a Journal Entry
1. Go to **Home** or click **"New Entry"**
2. Write a journal entry with some emotional content, for example:
   ```
   Today was amazing! I finally got the promotion I've been working toward for months. 
   I feel incredibly grateful and excited about this new opportunity. My family was 
   so supportive throughout this journey, and I couldn't have done it without them.
   I'm looking forward to the challenges ahead and feel really motivated to grow.
   ```
3. The entry will auto-save

### Step 3: Run AI Analysis
1. Open the journal entry (if not already viewing it)
2. Scroll down to find the **"Analyze with AI"** button
3. Click the button and wait for analysis (usually 10-30 seconds)
4. View the comprehensive results:
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Classification (positive/negative/neutral) with confidence
   - **Happiness Metrics**: Scores across 5 wellbeing dimensions
   - **Insights**: AI-generated observations about your mental state

### Step 4: Verify Data Persistence
1. Refresh the page or navigate away and back
2. The AI analysis results should still be visible
3. Try **Export Data** from Settings to see AI analysis included in JSON export

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Web Worker**: All AI processing runs in a dedicated Web Worker to prevent UI blocking
- **WebLLM Model**: Uses Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct optimized for browser execution
- **Database**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js stores analysis results persistently
- **React Context**: Global state management for AI model status and loading

### Key Files Created/Modified:
- `src/workers/ai.worker.ts` - Web Worker for AI processing
- `src/services/llmService.ts` - Main service interfacing with the worker
- `src/services/sentimentService.ts` - Sentiment analysis logic
- `src/services/metricsService.ts` - Happiness metrics calculation
- `src/components/AI/AIControlPanel.tsx` - Model loading interface
- `src/components/AI/AIAnalysisButton.tsx` - Analysis trigger and results display
- `src/contexts/LLMContext.tsx` - React context for global AI state
- `src/services/database.ts` - Updated with AI analysis persistence

### Performance & Privacy
- âœ… **No External Requests**: Everything runs locally using WebGPU
- âœ… **Non-Blocking**: Web Worker prevents UI freezing during analysis
- âœ… **Persistent Storage**: Results saved to IndexedDB for offline access
- âœ… **Export/Import**: Full data portability including AI analysis
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

## ðŸ§  AI Analysis Capabilities

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Classifications**: Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive
- **Confidence Scores**: 0-100% certainty in classification
- **Keywords**: Emotional indicators that influenced the analysis
- **Explanations**: Brief reasoning for the sentiment classification

### Happiness Metrics (1-10 Scale)
1. **Life Evaluation**: Overall life satisfaction and contentment
2. **Positive Affect**: Joy, gratitude, hope, inspiration levels
3. **Negative Affect**: Stress, worry, sadness levels (inverted scale)
4. **Social Support**: Sense of connection and relationship quality
5. **Personal Growth**: Learning, purpose, and accomplishment feelings

### Generated Insights
