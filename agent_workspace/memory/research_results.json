Run efficiently on high-end consumer laptops (16GB+ RAM, modern GPUs)\n2. Excel at sentiment analysis and emotional content understanding\n3. Are compatible with WebLLM/WebGPU deployment\n4. Have small enough file sizes for web deployment (under 4GB)\n5. Provide good instruction following for structured analysis\n\nAnalyze models like Llama 3.2 (1B/3B), Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen2.5, TinyLlama, and any other suitable candidates. Compare their:\n- Model size and memory requirements\n- Sentiment analysis capabilities\n- WebLLM compatibility\n- Performance benchmarks\n- Quantization options available\n\nProvide a recommendation for the best model for this use case.

      "task_summary": "## Task Summary: WebLLM-Compatible Models for Sentiment Analysis Research\n\n### Execution Process\nI conducted a comprehensive research analysis of WebLLM-compatible open source models optimal for sentiment analysis in journaling applications. The research followed a systematic 6-phase methodology:\n\n1. **Baseline Research**: Analyzed WebLLM framework architecture, WebGPU compatibility requirements, and deployment constraints\n2. **Model Specification Analysis**: Gathered detailed technical specifications for target models (Llama 3.2, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen2.5, TinyLlama, SmolLM, Gemma-2)\n3. **Sentiment Analysis Capability Assessment**: Evaluated models using SentiBench benchmark data and comparative studies\n4. **Performance & Deployment Analysis**: Created comprehensive visualizations and comparison matrices analyzing memory requirements, quantization impact, and deployment feasibility\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: Synthesized findings into multi-criteria comparisons with detailed trade-off analysis\n6. **Report Generation**: Compiled comprehensive research report with practical deployment guidance and actionable recommendations\n\n### Key Findings\n- **Total Models Analyzed**: 14 WebLLM-compatible models across 6 model families\n- **Sentiment Benchmarks Available**: 4 models with validated sentiment analysis performance data\n- **Deployment Constraint Compliance**: All models fit within 4GB file size requirement\n- **Hardware Compatibility**: 12 out of 14 models are low-resource compatible for consumer hardware\n\n### Core Conclusions\n**Primary Recommendation: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** emerges as the optimal choice, providing:\n- **Proven Performance**: 58.29% F1-score on SentiBench sentiment analysis benchmark\n- **Optimal Efficiency**: 1.89GB file size, 1888MB VRAM requirement  \n- **WebLLM Compatibility**: Full support with q4f32_1 quantization\n- **Structured Output**: Enhanced JSON generation capabilities for journaling insights\n\n**Alternative Recommendations**:\n- **High-Performance**: Gemma-2-2B (62.62% F1, best accuracy but larger footprint)\n- **Lightweight**: TinyLlama-1.1B (45.18% F1, most compact at 0.84GB)\n- **Future Potential**: Llama 3.2 models (strong instruction following, requires sentiment fine-tuning)\n\n### Final Deliverables\nThe research produced a comprehensive report with detailed model analysis, performance visualizations, deployment guidance, and practical implementation strategies for WebLLM-based sentiment analysis in journaling applications.",
