# WebLLM-Compatible Models for Sentiment Analysis - Research Plan

## Research Objectives
Identify and analyze WebLLM-compatible open source models optimal for journaling app sentiment analysis with specific focus on:
1. Efficient performance on high-end consumer laptops (16GB+ RAM, modern GPUs)
2. Excellence in sentiment analysis and emotional content understanding
3. WebLLM/WebGPU deployment compatibility
4. Web deployment file size constraints (under 4GB)
5. Strong instruction following for structured analysis
